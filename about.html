		<h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        	Home of The Little Big Book Dictionary. First printed November 1998. The culmination of nearly 3 years work and another 3 years of work in subsequent years. We now distribute over 1,000 copies every week.
        </p>
        <p>
        	We're Lyle and Theresa P. - two fellowship members.
            <br>
                SD's : Theresa - 4/19/95  Lyle - 2/8/83
            <br>
            Currently we have 6 employees, all but one of which are also active fellowship members, with a total of over 60 years sobriety and clean time. We know recovery first hand. Now having over 12 years in the recovery related medallion, book, and gift business we know the entire network of suppliers and competitors like no other.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Our current routine stock of medallions nears 200,000. Our routine stock of other items is similarly massive due to our ever growing sales volume demands.
            We know recovery circles and their needs first hand.
            Our aim is to responsively serve those needs with integrity and fairness.
        </p>
